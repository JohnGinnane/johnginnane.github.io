Due to financial difficulties I was unable to pay the fees for college, and so I dropped out of college in 2013. After a short time on social welfare I joined the work force a few months later in early 2014, starting work as a software assistant to a company that provides software to legal companies. Over the last ten years I have moved from supporting the software to writing it and maintain legacy software. I kept deferring going back to college as I was unsure how I could get a diploma if I was working full time, and what sort of course I would apply for.

With the introduction of the Springboard+ scheme I was able to find this course. I hope to complete the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing while continuing to work over the next two years. Some of the modules in the course, such as â€˜Software Developmentâ€™, â€˜Object Oriented Software Engineeringâ€™, and particularly â€˜Introduction to Databasesâ€™ will already be familiar to me having moved into a software engineer role in my work. However other modules in Year 2, such as â€˜Computer Architecture Operating Systems and Networksâ€™ and â€˜Distributed Systemsâ€™ are of particular interest and I hope to make use of any new information in my job to improve the software I write and maintain.

Right now I have almost 10 years of experience in my current job and the personal programming projects I have worked on as evidence of my knowledge. I hope to use this course as a formal recognition and to expand on this knowledge and experience of software development. Furthermore I hope to find other subjects that might interest me more and could be useful in my current position, where I could specialise in that subject, for example web development for enterprise, using tools such as Microsoft Azure.
