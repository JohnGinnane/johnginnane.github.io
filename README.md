Just a test page for HTML I can upload to.

I use [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) to convert the hue value into a hex string, which is extremely easy with this framework

I also use [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)'s mousemove event to get the position of the cursor as it moves around the page.
